# Specifications 

The codemodder project includes a collection language-specific libraries for building codemods that meet the [codemodder specifications](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-specs). These specifications describe things like the inputs (like the CLI parameters to codemods) and the outputs (the file format that describes the changes to make.)
