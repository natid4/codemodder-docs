# Licensing

The philosophy of our licensing is relatively simple. We want to offer an open source license that allows people to write their own codemods, use them for the internal purposes and solve their own problems, publish them widely if desired, but prevent commercial entities from leveraging our continued investment at our expense for their commercial gain.  

## Codemodder Frameworks
All of our codemodder frameworks, the libraries for each language that are used by people to build codemods, are available as Affero GPL (AGPL).

## Core Codemods
All of our codemodder frameworks also retain a set of core codemods which are of common interest for the broad community. These are available as Affero GPL (AGPL).

## Documentation
Our documentation is available as MIT.
